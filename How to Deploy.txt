---Front-End---

-Open command prompt and go inside to the Client folder in my case "C:\Users\Ranmal\Desktop\IT16169036\Client"
then execute the following command;
C:\Users\Ranmal\Desktop\IT16169036\Client>npm install

-After that execute the following command to run the "National Rail" web application;
C:\Users\Ranmal\Desktop\IT16169036\Client>npm run dev

-Then this output will be diplayed;
> client@1.0.0 dev C:\Users\Ranmal\Desktop\IT16169036\Client
> parcel ./index.html

Server running at http://localhost:1234
√  Built in 34.98s.


-After that paste the above url "http://localhost:1234" in web browser to display web application.(some times the port number will be different in your machines)


---Back-End---

-Open command prompt and go inside to the Services folder in my case "C:\Users\Ranmal\Desktop\IT16169036\Services
then execute the following command;
C:\Users\Ranmal\Desktop\IT16169036\Services>npm install

-After that execute the following command to run the Web Server;
C:\Users\Ranmal\Desktop\IT16169036\Services>npm run start-server

-Then this output will be diplayed
> services@1.0.0 start-server C:\Users\Ranmal\Desktop\IT16169036\Services
> node ./service.js

Connected to MongoDB
Server Started at http://localhost:3000/

**That means your web server is up and running**


---Database Setup----

-Open command prompt and go inside to the "MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin" folder where MongoDB is installed in my case "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin"
then execute the following command;
C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin>mongo

-After that you will enter to the MongoDB Shell, create database called "RailwayReservation" using following command in MongoDB Shell;
>use RailwayReservation

-After that go inside to the "IT16169036\MongoDB Scripts" folder and copy all the MongoDB commands in "Government Officers DB" and paste in MongoDB Shell and execute.

-After that go inside to the "IT16169036\MongoDB Scripts" folder and copy all the MongoDB commands in "Trains DB" and paste in MongoDB Shell and execute.

---WSO2 EI(ESB)---

-If you are deploying WSO2 EI

	-Go inside "IT16169036\WSO2 Enterprise Integration Eclipse Project\NationalRail\NationalRailComposite\target" folder.
	-Copy the "NationalRailComposite_1.0.0.car" file to the WSO2 server.
	-The folder to copy the above car file in the server in my case looks like "6.4.0\repository\deployment\server\carbonapps"


	-If you are using Eclipse Developer Studio open the below mentioned folder inside "IT16169036\WSO2 Enterprise Integration Eclipse Project" ;
		 "NationalRail" -> maven multi module project
		
	-Then add WSO2 Remote Server to the Eclipse Developer Studio and verify the ip obtain by running "integrator.bat" file and verify login credentials.
	
	-Then add "NationalRailComposite" car file to the server and click finish.
	
	-Finally double click on added WSO2 Remote Server to start the server then "NationalRailComposite" car file deployed to the WSO2 Server.
